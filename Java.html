<h2>What makes learning it important?</h2>
Java is used to develop enterprise-level applications for video games and mobile apps, as well as to create web-based applications with JSP (Java Server Pages). When used online, Java allows applets to be downloaded and used through a browser, which can then perform a function not normally available.

Programs that use or are written in Java include Adobe Creative Suite, Eclipse, Lotus Notes, Minecraft and OpenOffice.
Java is the core foundation for developing Android apps.
Features:
Application portability
Robust and interpreted language
Extensive network library
<h2>Where did it start?</h2>
Originally known as Oak, Java was developed in 1990 at Sun Microsystems to add capabilities to the C++ language. Java was developed according to the principle of WORA (Write Once Run Anywhere). The language was introduced to the public in 1995 and is now owned by Oracle.
